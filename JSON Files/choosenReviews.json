When the washer won't drain or spin out enough water.. or the dryer gives me the dreaded \"F something or other\" message... and refuses to work, I am able to give them a 'rest' for a month because this is not my only laundry but for small washes... no sheets or towels.

I can relate to all the problems stated -- from broken seals causing floods in my kitchen to replacement mother boards due to water damage. As also mentioned in other reviews, finding a qualified service person is very difficult. The last problem resulted in a visit from two different service men and neither could figure out why the top drawer sprung open on it's own and then I (nor they) could get it to stay closed. While a great concept, these dishwashers are designed very poorly. I love the look, and the noise level was good for the first year, but that's about it.

Just like every other Whirlpool appliance I have experience with, the dishwasher's performance is mediocre, so I ran a few loads of dishes with the Sani-Rinse option enabled to see if it would improve the thoroughness of the rinse cycle.  After running a few a loads this way, the rinse aid cap started to leak it's contents down the door of the dishwasher between loads.  Since the Sani-Rinse option apparently uses hotter water, I assumed the hotter water had caused the plastic in the old cap to warp or shrink, so I ordered this replacement cap.  I paid this item's ridiculous price because it was a legit part, and it came packaged in a bag that was labeled Whirlpool.  It did indeed stop the leaking...\n\n...for 10 months.  Now this cap is also leaking, even though I haven't again used the Sani-Rinse option.  Perhaps that means that the Sani-Rinse option warped the plastic in the door, rather than the plastic in the cap?  Who knows, your guess is as good as mine.  Regardless, in my experience this kind of performance is par for the course for Whirlpool, and is just further justification for why I will never voluntarily buy a Whirlpool appliance.\n\nUPDATE:  I've used Earth Friendly Product's WaveJet rinse aid for years, and is what I was using for the entirety of my experience in my review.

I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.

First, he told me they don't do returns, then he retracted and stated they only do returns if the customer is really dissatisfied and then they charge a 25% restocking fee, plus freight charges. WOW! You send me a defective item and then charge me when I want to return it. How do you like that for customer service?!\n\nThe washer filled up with water and then just quit working. It's only been used a few times. When you try to start a cycle, it just beeps and turns off. Also, it put holes in some of my clothes. The strange thing is, when I do an Internet search for consumer reviews on this item there are only a few and the majority of them are bad. All the other manufacturers have hundreds of reviews on their washers (all positive) and rate about a 4.5 out of 5 stars. It looks like no one is purchasing this washer. I also noticed that the few positive reviews on this GE washer have comments like, \"Great washer and it didn't rip my clothes....\" \"This washer cleans my clothes really well and didn't damage them...\" \"My clothes don't get holes in them when I wash them.\" What odd comments. It sounds to me like all the positive reviews were written by GE employees and they're totally aware that the washer rips your clothes. Well, my cothes DID get damaged during the wash and they've arranged it to cost a fortune to return the appliance so the consumer will be better off just keeping it. I already paid over $2,000 for the set.\n\nI think it's despicable to sell such a crappy product in the first place, but then to make it unaffordable for your customers to return the item is criminal!

The biggest problem is the way it makes the ice.  It freezes around a little pole and then gets dropped off into a bucket.  But, since it's around a pole the outside never completely freezes, it is always wet when it goes into the cooler part so no matter how fast you take the ice out and put it in the freezer it will freeze together.  I suppose if people are serving themselves from the ice maker it would be okay. When the ice melts it goes right into new ice which is nice, but I can't imagine letting it run 24/7 for just a household.  Regardless I still use it and put the ice in the freezer, then I just have to smash it around a bit to break it up.  It works fine for me because I crush it afterwords anyways.  Even the small setting isn't small, it's just hollow, like something you haven't seen before i'm sure.", "summary": "Wet .. wet .. wet ..."}
{"overall": 2.0, "reviewText": "So, we bought this gas stove at the end of 2007.  I cook a lot, we entertain and eat at home all the time.  I really wanted a Viking stove, but they are just too expensive for our budget.  I loved the design of this stove, if I recall it was new to market when we bought it so we didn't look into reviews.  I know we spent over $3k on it, maybe overpriced compared to todays prices.\n\nWhat other people are saying is true, the knobs are completely s***.  I found knobs to replace on ebay, saved some money but a new set was about $150.  The knobs after a few years literally were pealing apart since they are made of plastic.  They also get really hot, like untouchable hot.  But only if I have been cooking constantly it seems ie; Christmas or Easter etc.\n\nI do feel the stove scratches a lot on the top, the rubber feet that hold the grates in place pop out very easy too.  We had to order replacements but they don't fit as good so I even tried using a little super glue.  Downside, your pan never sits evenly on the grate, so if you are making eggs for example, they slide to one side of the pan.\n\nRecently our \"LOC\" is flashing and the gas/stove won't work at all.  After researching, we discovered the motherboard is to blame.  It also suggested we shut the stove off completely for 12 hours and start it again.  We did, and to our surprise the stove top gas works, oven still flashes \"LOC\" and the oven won't work.\n\nBottom line, I bought a GE Convection double oven stove for our rental unit 11 years ago.  I believe I paid on clearance $900.  Its electric, maybe that makes a difference not sure.  Still going strong, no issues.  This really irritates me the oven we spent 3x's the money on has crapped out.  We don't know how much it will cost to fix, service call is $75 alone.  My husband will try to replace the board.  We will see what that costs.....", "summary": "Issues...."}

This is the latest of the below average products we purchased there. It is a good design and we like how the drain is high enough to sit on the counter with our raised sink. It's fairly large and can accommodate large plates and a lot of items. In the first several weeks we were very happy with the product. Then the stains started showing up. It definitely rusts less than rebar, but no one would use rebar for a dish rack. So with a Brilo pad and much elbow grease, we scrubbed off the brown stains on all the wires. We thought, \"wow, it came right off; problem solved!\" Wrong! Two weeks later and it came back. It will stain any dish you place on the wire rack. Whatever comes in contact with the rack will stain. We give up. So here I am on Amazon looking for a plastic replacement. No more metal dish racks.\n\nUpdate: I called the manufacturer who apologized for our problems and sent us a replacement. In our conversation, she said that only the sheet metal side are made of stainless steel and that the wire rack is some kind of chromed steel. I said if they improved on this and she said, no. She said to try it out and see if it still rusts. It did! Since I need a raised drainer for our raised sink, I will simply cut out the rack (the parts that touch our dishes) and place a plastic rack on top of it.", "summary": "Good idea but it's not stainless steel, it's chrome plated steel, so it rusts badly."}

For the past three years we had noticed a sickly, trash-like, sour smell coming from our laundry room, and had the pipes and drains checked with no result. Every day, I scrubbed the grout on the tile floor with bleach because we had mold appear every morning between the tiles. We ran a dehumidifier in there. We made sure that our clothes were simply sweaty, and didn't throw things in that were muddy or covered with food.\n\nThen last month I heard about the CLASS ACTION suit in Ohio against Whirlpool re the Duet Sport because it encourages and harbors mold growth. I decided to do some poking around in my machine and--lo and behold--the while plastic rim surrounding the metal barrel (behind the black rubber seal if you pull it back) is covered with slimy black mold. Apparently the back wheel behind the barrel often gets covered in it, too.  I emailed Whirlpool and they told me to run three cycles of Affresh (did you know Affresh is made by Whirlpool?) and that we must be letting wet things sit too long, etc.\n\nWe went out today and got an LG top loader so we can get that thing the heck out of our house, and also trashed the hoses because they too were coated with smelly gunk. That kind of mold build up will make you seriously ill, ESPECIALLY if you have young ones with rooms in close proximity to the machine.

After 3 more cleanings, the filter lost its shape and will no longer stand upright in my humidifier.  The whole filter is cheaply glued together with what looks to be a single line from a hot glue gun.  That seam failed.  The black mesh wrap is also paper and non-structural.\n\nAfter closer inspection of the details on the Holmes website, I see that it is recommended to be replaced after only 2 weeks.

Some other models in this price range have those gross wire shelves that are difficult to clean and get mess everywhere if you spill. The gallon storage isn't as convenient as I thought it would be.  It works great for storing my milk, however any condiment/dressing that you usually store in the door may fall out if it is a thinner bottle. That being said, if you think about it when you put your stuff away, you can be sure to put the wider bottles on the outside so that the skinny bottles will never even get close to falling out. I just buy really big bottles of Ketchup and I am 100% happy!\n\nThe freezer of this fridge DOES have a wire rack, but I think that is pretty standard for even fancy freezers.\n\nThe reason why I am giving it 4 stars out of five is because it doesn't filter water, and therefore could never be an awesome fridge (although it DOES have an optional ice-maker add on). I don't really have a problem with the fridge being 'loud' like the other comments, but haven't really 'listened to it' and don't spend a ton of time worrying about it. Unless you sleep in your kitchen, it doesn't really make any difference to me.\n\nMy suggestion: Order it from bestbuy, I got mine on sale for ~499 sticker price, delivery included, plus the best buy guys are pretty awesome with delivery - super on time and made a quick job of getting the fridge through a turning stairway and narrow hallway. -- No Fuss.", "summary": "Good Fridge for Price"}

{"overall": 2.0, "reviewText": "Since you're paying a lot for a little fridge like this, it ought to work right. Unfortunately that is not what happens with this model. My advice is to avoid it if you have a better option, or be sure to get an extended service contract. These can be purchased at any time.\n\nPoor Design:\n\n* The doors typically pop back open a little when you close them with a push, and the door alarm will not sound if this happens.\n\n* The water dispenser is in a terrible location, as is the icemaker. They get in the way, and both are more trouble than they are worth.\n\n* The plastic cover for the deli tray attaches to plastic pegs to crate a hinge. These pegs get stressed and break pretty easily, just from regular use. The deli cover will start popping loose and then the pegs break.\n\nKnown Water/Ice problems:\n\n* Food in the back of the fridge routinely freezes even with the internal thermostat set at 38 degrees F. I've found other Kitchenaid fridge owners mentioning this problem online. One suggested solution is to not use the icemaker, but that hasn't worked for me. Items at the back of the fridge tend to freeze.\n\n* Worse, after a year of use the drain system clogged and iced up, which requires significant effort or a professional to fix. The condenser is constantly removing humidity to a drain that terminates in a pan under the fridge where an evaporator (heater) is supposed to disperse it into the outside/room air. If the drain line clogs it will ice up, and then the newly draining water will pool in the bottom of the freezer. You may not notice this until there is a large sheet of ice at the bottom of the freezer and incoming drain water is going over the ice and out the freezer door onto your floor. This isn't all that obvious, so like me the first thing you might notice is your wood floor warping and sinking under one of the front feet of the fridge. To clear the drain everything has to be removed and the fridge shut down to de-ice. Then you can snake the drain line or flush it with air or water. If the icing resumes, you probably have a broken evaporator.\n\nI had this icing problem just as our 1 year warranty was expiring. Fortunately it still covered us, and we bought additional 5 year coverage. I'm adjusting my rating up to 3 stars since the problem was not too severe, but finding out it's a common problem -- and in the first year -- seems to indicate an engineering fault.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAfter a year and a half of ownership requiring service for repairs, I'm revising my rating up to 2 stars. Repairs took care of everything but the tendency for food in the back of the fridge to freeze, although a certified Kitchenaid repairman hoped that adjusting the doors and seal would help. It's possible the front door seals are simply inadequate or there is another problem causing the freezing inside the fridge at a 38 degree temperature setting. Either way, it and the other things mentioned above seem to be engineering faults that are common to this model. It is serviceable with luck and care, but I do not like or recommend it.", "summary": "Sub-par design and performance."}

It's been a week now and it still works, which is progress.  The instructions suck.  You have to read them a few times and study the pictures.  It took me about two hours to do this.  A word of advice:  the new part that travels in a U shape back and forth has a nylon part on it.  This nylon part goes on the outside of the ice maker between the U shaped rail it travels in and the replacement motor.  It does not go directly in the U shaped rail.  It is meant to make a connection on either end of the U and if it's in the U rail directly it won't be positioned right.  It will also have trouble travelling.  Second point: There's a heating wire that needs to be connected to a copper pipe/wire thingy travelling from the back of the ice maker to the front.  Look closely and the instructions make it clear where it needs to go, but it took me about ten minutes to get that part figured out.  The directions say to zip strip it onto the copper thing but they don't include zip strips in the kit. You'll need those.  The rest of the instructions are pretty much straight forward. They also include a bunch of upgrade stuff in the kit not directly related to the ice maker issues, such as bushings for the doors.\n\n11/16/17 update:  Still working. Makes Ice but the capacity is not as high as I would like.  As in the bucket gets to a certain amount of fill and then stops making ice.

{"overall": 1.0, "reviewText": "I decided to try these filters because they were significantly cheaper than the GE authentic filters and highly rated. The bottom line is you get what you pay for. The water tasted different than the filtered water using the GE product and/or the PUR filter (which is what my Maytag refrigerator uses) I have in a second home of mine. This caused me to research these filters and they do not clean out as many contaminants from the water as the others two brands. I did not return them because the filtering difference was minimal (98 vs. 100 percent of chemicals, etc..) but the price difference was so substantial. The real problem is that they do not last ... my GE filter might cost me $44 but it lasts me about 9 months or so. This filter is only three months old and I just threw it in the garbage. It was dead ... the water was dispensing at such a low rate that I just wound up replacing it with a GE filter. I am throwing the second filter that came in this two pack out.

{"overall": 3.0, "reviewText": "I have been using this oven for several months.  I'm a serious amateur baker and I use it quite often for baking breads and pastries.  It has its strong points. It is quiet, holds its heat well and bakes evenly, especially in Convection mode. It seems well built and the controls are not overly complex.  The hidden lower element makes cleaning the floor of the oven a snap.  But it does suffer from some serious problems--design flaws--in my opinion.  A relatively minor complaint is that when broiling, the oven cuts off power to the elements whenever the door is opened.  I often use the broiler for browning the tops of casseroles, pastries etc. and I like to be able to observe the browning process directly, not through the oven glass.  But as soon as the door is opened, the power to the elements is cut and they cool down.  It's an unnecessary, CYA sort of safey feature.\n\nMy major complaint though is with the temperature regulating system on this oven.  Most reasonable people would assume that when you set the oven to a given temperature, and when the oven beeps, indicating that it has preheated to the set temperature, it has in fact reached that temperature.  With this oven that assumption would be a serious mistake.  For example, if the oven is set to 350 F., its actual internal temperature at the end of the preheat period, as measured with an accurate oven thermometer, is actually only 280 to 300 F.  It may take as long as 20 minutes or longer for the oven to reach the actual temperature to which it has been set.  Now, if you're making a pot roast, this may not be a problem.  But if you are baking bread and both temperature and baking times must be very precise, this is a disaster.  Even though the owners manual clearly states that once preheating is complete--i.e. when the oven beeps and displays 5 bars--it has reached the \"set temperature\", it in fact hasn't even come close to the set temperature.\n\nTo its credit, once the oven does reach the set temperature, it holds that temperature very accurately and consistently.  But the only way to know what the true temperature is at any given time is to use an accurate oven thermometer and a flashlight to help you read it.  Unfortunately, Bosch does not supply these, even as accessories.  An oven that costs $1,500 should not require the use of auxiliary equipment, supplied by the user, in order to be useable.  After several fruitless conversations with Bosch technicians, I finally got one of them to admit that the oven is functioning exactly as designed (regardless of what the manual claims) and that there is nothing that can be done to change that.  I continue to use the oven, always making sure to give it an extra half-hour of preheat time and then checking the internal temperature manually, but I would not buy it again.\n\nOne other point.  This oven is not a true convection oven (nor does it claim to be.)  In other words, in Convection Mode it uses a fan to circulate the air within the oven, producing a more even heat.  But the fan is not coupled with a separate heating element as in a true convection oven.  That's not a problem for me because I'm more interested in even browning than in reduced cooking times.  But if you need true convection, this isn't the oven for you.", "summary": "Some serious problems"}

I am a single mom and I shelled out a good bit of money to get a nice washer and dryer -- my first set. I wish I had done my research before buying these. I never really liked it once I got it home. I thought it took entirely too long to wash a load of clothes that didn't smell very clean after they were washed. I dealt with it by purchasing the more expensive brand of detergent and used lots of fabric softener in the washer and dryer sheets in the dryer. After a while, I started noticing I had garments that had gray residue on them along with little holes after washing them. This was sickening because I certainly don't have the money to throw away clothes that were in great condition before WASHING them. I mean, really? Who would expect their washing machine to tear up their clothes?? I just took my chances every time I washed, hoping that this load would be lucky and not come out with torn-up clothing. I tried medium and small loads and it was really hit or miss as to when the washer would decide to eat my laundry. Then even after leaving the door open after washing a load and using the cleaning cycle, the smell of my clothing got worse than before. Again, I just dealt with it. So one day I notice water in the floor of my laundry room. After I did some investigating, I realized there was now a huge hole in the door seal of the washer. So now I can't wash anything at all unless I want clothes that still smell and a wet floor :( Maytag has no interest in fixing it unless I pay for a service call plus parts and labor. I've read reviews just like mine all over the internet. You'd think Maytag would do a recall and offer a fix for this faulty machine. It's so disappointing and really makes me sick to my stomach.

{"overall": 3.0, "reviewText": "Major differences here than what you are used to with old-school center post top loading washers. The most frustrating thing with this washer is that it is complex( e.g. figuring out how to use it or customize options to get the results you want) Once you figure that out, you may be quite happy with it:\n\na. Leaving coins, paper clips, pens in your pocket then trying to wash these garments in this washer will ruin the washer and your clothes.\n\nb. All buttons should be buttoned, zippers should be zipped, Velcro should be fastened and garments should be turned inside out if they have these fasteners on them before washing them in this washer (pain in the butt, I know) Garment net bags might be a god idea for some items.\n\n1. You cannot select the wash water level you want regardless of what the amount of clothes you are going to wash is.\n\n2a. This washer doesn't seem to wash small loads well. It needs the buoyancy of other garments to help move the load around\n\n2. You cannot select the wash time duration manually. This is done for you when you select the soil level and type of fabric\n\n3. It does not have a center post agitator, it has a large disc agitator that moves clothes in a blooming fashion. Because the clothes spend a long time on the wash plate and rubbing together, they don't have to turn over as often as what you are used to with a center post agitator\n\n4. And I don't care what anyone says, these types of washers cannot wash queen size and larger comforters well. The bunched up garment will not be turned over and will basically soak and spin while 75% of its circumference is scrubbed.. You can pause it and flip it yourself a couple times, but this is an automatic washer, right?? ;\\\n\nIf you are a ranch hand, farmer, mechanic or someone who otherwise gets their clothes very dirty regularly--- this is probably NOT the washer for you. You're better off with a top load Speed Queen. I believe these LG washers are more designed for city folk adults who work in offices, that occasionally get their clothes very dirty etc...Although they seem to clean construction workers clothes just fine.\n\n I advise using HE plant based laundry soaps. Petroleum based liquid laundry detergents tend to gum up too much which isn't good for these washers at all.\n\nWash temperature wash options range from tap cold to cold to semi-warm to warm to hot. (With cold, the machine adds a little bit of hot water in order to get powdered chemicals to dissolve properly, but the water will still feel cold- Tap Cold ---> the cold temperature of the water isn't modified at all)\n\n Hot water sets a lot of stains and really isn't necessary to clean clothes. Warm water can yield similar effects. If it is bacteria you are worried about, you can use hydrogen peroxide or bleach. People like using hot water because it loosens the viscosity of oily soils, and it has an antiseptic effect, but detergent an hydrogen peroxide can do this too. This machine will not use straight scalding hot water from the tap. It just won't. LG nannies you regarding this, telling us we don't need it, it wastes energy and it is not good for our clothes. Lucky for them, I don't have a lot of white clothes. White clothes show stains and stain easily. I even have very little articles of white underwear, t shirts or socks anymore. I don't like white clothing.\n\nYou should wash all similar fabric and type together. (New washing technology does not negate the need for sorting your clothes, it increases it. Sorry guys) You cannot wash jeans with dress shirts in one load, etc. This might cause unbalancing, linting, etc. I haven't had any  unbalancing issues. Just male sure the washer is level and you shouldn't either\n\nAre you a dry detergent fan? No problem- just take the cup adapter out and put the dry detergent and dry detergent additives in as well (although I've never had any problem just putting these chemicals in the bottom of the tub at the start of the wash before I put my fabrics in)\n\n-----Extra Rinse Button: This button is an important feature and cycle modification option that I feel compelled to explain because it has 3 functions. If your clothes are extra dirty (mechanic/gardener/ranch hand) you may feel compelled to add extra detergent/soap to the wash. This is understandable. However an extra rinse may be needed to get the soap out. Pushing the button once gives and extra rinse. Pushing it twice programs the machine to add two extra rinses. I don't think it tells this in the instructions, it only mentions that it gives one extra rinse -- not true.\n\n(Extra Rinse button features cont.)\n-----Extra Water (Water Plus)  For those of of you that like your clothes washed in lots of water (Who doesn't? :) ) you may want to learn about the extra water option found on the Extra Rinse button, by pressing it and holding it for 5 seconds. The machine will not indicate on the panel that \"extra wash water\" is set - It will just beep. :/  I washed about  1/2 tub load full of towels on the heavy duty cycle, and by using the extra wash water (water plus) option, the tub filled almost all the way up with water ,causing the towels to turnover about once every 3 seconds during the wash cycle. (pretty darn good) They also were not rubbing together nearly as much as before.\n\n-----Lid Lock.. It has one. This is for customers who have families with toddlers. Many households don't have toddlers, so this should be an option, not standard equipment.. For years we had top load washers without lid locks and we survived just fine. I can understand having it lock while it's spinning, but there is no need to have it locked all the time. What if the lock malfunctions?\n\n-----Smart Diagnosis/Tag On allows you to call and touch your phone to a part of the washer to allow LGs computer's to assess problems you are having with the washer. I'm in a household of two male adults and we've never had to use this feature. We have had the washer for a year now.\n\n-----Delicate cycle is too delicate. Seems like it is for chiffon and pantyhose not dress shirts, etc. I use the normal cycle for delicates.\n\n----Tag- On allows Android NFC (near field communication)- equipped Android smart phone users to get access to cycles not available on the washer's control panel, and to control some of the washer's functions by Android smart phone remote control. *update 2-6-2017 I've heard that LG no longer offers the Tag- On feature for this model because people were confused by it and hardly anyone used it.\n\n----Custom Program Button on the washer's control panel only allows you to store 1 custom program at a time, so some people might find the Tag-On and remote functions useful.  I basically don't want to make washing my clothes that complicated or intricate, so I doubt if i'll be using the Tag On feature to customize cycles, etc.  :)\n\n----Non-Slam Lid- Lid can't be slammed. It has pneumatic axles on its hinges that slow down effects of gravity.\n\nTricks: ________________\n---Speed Wash: The speed eash cycle is very short and some people have told me they have used it successfully as a semi-manual prewash in addtion to its original function when they have e.g. a few dish towels to wash, etc.\n\n---Wetting clothes before hand. If you make the clothes soaking wet before hand, when you turn the machine on it will think the clothes are heavier than they are therefore making the machine fill with more water than it ordinarily would\n\n---Permanent Press -- although it has no permanent press cycle normal wash and low spin and semi-warm water wash do perm press just fine\n\nPet Peeves:::::\n-----Overall if it were up to me, I wouldn't buy this washer, the one I'm using now is a \"rental\". I would want something to wash my comforters and they advertise this machine like it  washes them so well, which is a lie. What a joke. It barely washes them. Only front load tumble washers clean those right.\n\n----- It can wrinkle and twist clothes if there is a low water level in machine\n\n-----Marathon cycle times. | e.g. 3 hours to do a load of towels? (2 loads of towels in a normal size washer) You can kind of get around this by not washing clothes that are super dirty and washing smaller loads and not modifying the cycle. But, I don't know about you, I want my clothes clean, not partially clean, and if it takes that long to get the results I want with this washer, oh well.\n\n-----Spends too much time measuring torque resistance. This should only have to be done twice, not throughout the whole cycle. That seems kind of silly. Maybe it's to cover their tracks for people who constantly like to add stuff to the tub after the washer has started\n\n-----Lid Lock.. I don't like it. This is for customers who have families with toddlers. Many households don't have toddlers. For years we had top load washers without lid locks and we survived just fine. I can understand having it lock while it's spinning, but there is no need to have it locked all the time.\n\n-----Leveling...You better have this washer leveled.  Otherwise the tub may wobble like \"hep\" and bang against the outer cabinet. Even leveled, the tub seems to wobble too much.\n\n-----Overpriced. I didn't buy it here, but even paying $800 for it (what my roommate paid) seems kind of ridiculous. Oh, but it's going to save you so much water, right?  Our water bill is totally covered with the homeowner's association fees.  :\\", "summary": "It's mediocre, but comforters?--Forget it. Marathon wash times are annoying."}
