{"reviewText": "This filter replacement fit the air cleaner unit with substantial gaps. The quality of this filter is a cheap imitation of the original filter that performs at approximately 35-45% of the factory filter. It is constructed with a thin cardboard-like casing that does not seal for an airtight fit. The edges leave a large enough gap between the filter and slot on the unit that for the 1st time of the unit's life, there is a moderate amount of buildup on the inside of the unit. The unit is used in a 12x16 family room and since the filter quality is so low, the unit no longer performs as it did before changing to this filter. The casing of the original filter is a hard plastic, not a paper casing like this replacement. The actual filtering part of the replacement, one side is a netted plastic which does not trap air particles, and the other side is a thin hepa type filter, if that is what they classify it as, has little effect on air cleaning. Please note that at the cost of this disposable filter, (the 1st one fell apart when it was cleaned) makes it a costly 1 time use filter. I am glad I saved my old filter because it works a good 80% better. I will be using it instead of this 2 pack.\nI have pleural fibrosis & asthma and for my condition (which is not in the moderate stage yet), this is an insufficient replacement for cleaning the air.

{"reviewText": "Update two years later:  I still LOVE my EdgeStar Kegerator.  It still keeps my beer ice cold.  I recently bought an AcuRite Deluxe Wireless Weather Center (atomic clock) at Costco (for about $30).  The reason I bought it is that it has an outside transmitter that sends the outside temperature to the unit so you can tell what the temp is outside as well as inside.  This unit also measures humidity and some other stuff I wasn't interested in.  I wanted to monitor my beer temperature without having to open the fridge door.  I simply put the outside transmitter inside the kegerator on top of my keg.  It works GREAT!  In fact, the unit I bought not only tells you the current temp (inside and outside) but it also registers the high and low for the day.  It resets itself at midnight each night.  So now, with the outside transmitter sitting on top of my keg inside the kegerator, I not only know the exact temperature of my beer at the time I'm pouring it, but also the range that my EdgeStar has kept my beer for the past day.  Knowing the current temp was my target.  Getting a 24 hour high and low is a real bonus.  As said before, I like my beer near freezing.  Several times I came up with frozen lines and had to let them thaw.  Now, I can see the temperature range for the past 24 hours and monitor the low to make sure I don't freeze again.  Still a very happy beer drinker.\n\nOriginal Review: I did a lot of research on kegerators before deciding to buy this one by EdgeStar.  I have wanted a kegerator for years to replace the system I had in an old refridgerator in the garage.  What prompted me to actually pull the trigger is that I saw one at Costco for under $400.  I came home and began researching that unit online.  What a rip!  Breaking down.....poor customer service....beer not getting above 40 degrees.  Yuck!!  Then I stumbled on this unit from EdgeStar.  While there were no reviews for this dual tap model in Amazon, I was able to find plenty of written reviews on their single tap models.  I called Edgestar to verify that the dual and single units were, in fact, the same fridge and they are.  Several of the reviewers mentioned that they couldn't get the unit below 40 degrees (much like most of the other manufacturers I researched) but that just one call to EdgeStar customer service resulted in very detailed instructions on how to adjust the thermostat to get the unit to go lower.  I put mine together in a matter of 30 minutes and had it plugged in and cooling down.  I didn't put a keg into it for maybe 5 days wanting to see if it would be cold enough.  Sure enough, mine got to 40 degrees and stopped there.  I like my beer very cold......I mean near frozen.....so I wanted to get this new unit down to maybe 33 or 34 degrees.  I emailed EdgeStar customer service one evening around midnight.  When I got up in the morning I had an email response with an explanation of various factors that could prevent it from getting cold enough.  For example, having it outside or building it in so there isn't enough space around the unit for the cooling system to operate efficiently.  Mine is free standing so I didn't have any of the issues that would have prevented it from getting cold enough.  The email went on to provice very detailed instructions on how to reset the thermostat to get it to cool down more.  They even provide pictures showing the procedure step by step.  The final step was to tighten the little set screw in \"finger tight\" then back it off 2 full turns.  After reassembling the thermostat it suggests letting it work for 24 hours.  I did and MAN! did it work a lot better.  In fact, the instructions state that if it gets too cold you need to repeat the last step and back the set screw off 3 full turns instead of 2.  Since my unit got to 30 degrees overnight (and froze the beer lines that lead to the tap tower) I repeated Step 5 and backed it back 3 full turns.  Now, two days later, my beer comes flowing freely at 33 or 34 degrees.  JUST AS I LIKE IT!!\n\nIf you are considering a new kegerator, EdgeStar units are GREAT!!  Their customer service is lightning fast and very easy to deal with.  Also, while you are spending $450 to $499 for a single tap unit, go ahead and get the two tap unit.  It's only about $50 more and gives you plenty of options as to what beers you can enjoy.  Two of the 1/6th barrel tall skinny kegs fit perfectly in there.  There are lots of beers available in 1/6th kegs so you can be the King of the Keg in your neighborhood by having the only duel tap in your Man Cave!!  Besides, you also have the option of putting a half or quarter barrel in there too.  They all fit!!\n\nSo, don't just sit there reading and researching.  Buy this unit and start enjoying an ICE COLD BEER!!!", "summary": "Perfect Kegerator for an ICE COLD BEER!!", "originalRating": 5.0, "ourRating": "", "modelRating": ""}
{"reviewText": "The Ice maker arrived very well packed (at least I thought it did anyways).  I wasn't too keen on whatever they put on the steel (some blue plastic cover thing that you have to pull off though it was a minor issue), but it was fairly easy to take it off though there were certain areas that I could not pull it off the Ice maker so not really a big deal just annoying.  I ran the machine for a couple of times and threw out the ice just so that it gets broken in and if any tastes or smells linger they would go away though I noticed neither.  The Ice maker is very quiet all you hear is the ice dropping; the fan occasionally, and the pump as it draws water into the machine from the water well (or whatever you want to call it).  I've only had the ice maker for less than a month or so and so far have not noticed any problems, so only time will tell how it holds up (and any updates that I add later on down the road).  It looks like a well put together product even for one coming out of China which nowadays seems like just about everything else although I did wipe down the inside of the product as there was some kind of stain (dirt or something else I don't know that got past the quality control point) in it that wiped up fairly easy enough.  The ice doesn't have any weird taste that I can detect and everything seems to be in working order so far.  I would recommend this product to others.\n\nUpdate December 27th 2012\n\nThe ice maker now automatically switches to the smallest type of ice tube/cube (whatever you want to call it) size.  The clean function doesn't even work.  When it worked; it worked great, now that it has started to act up it's a pain in the proverbial rear end.  When I purchase another ice maker machine I won't be buying it from this company.

In the last three months alone, this dispenser failed, the spring assembly that counterbalances the door snapped a cable, the \"Start\" pushbutton switch failed, and two days ago, the thermal fuse went, taking the unit down AGAIN.\n\nI tend to do my own repairs on things like this, and it's turning into a full time 'hobby' now.

{"reviewText": "There are some great things about this dishwasher (built 2003) and some things that are not so great. The best thing about the dishwasher is how easy it is to load and unload. For a household of two or three people, you find yourself filling and emptying the top drawer only, and once a day. No stooping, pulling out separate trays, trying to get silverware in basket at ankle level, and no door down tripping hazard. It is well built, quiet, and customer service is great. Love calling and finding a friendly Aussie to chat with (CS is in Australia, not NZ). And compared to my new washer, the dishes were dry.\n\nBut there are issues related to the design that make it less than trouble free. The basic problem is inherent with the two drawer concept. First it is a matter of drawer space particularly height. Because you have two pump agitator units and separate drawers each with a lid assembly the drawer is shallow and your bigger dishes  may not fit or something may block the lid from closing (resulting in flooding error.)  Also the distance between the spray arm and the dish rack is so close any thing slightly sticking down will block the arm and your dishes aren't clean. But with care in loading you can avoid both of these issues. (techniques I learned, my wife didn't) But others you can't.\n\nEach drawer has separate fill and drain hoses. These have to extend in and out each  time you open or close the door. There is a harness that keeps the hoses from kinking.  The plastic harness eventually will break and then your troubles begin. (I'm told the new ones have a better harness design.) Also the mechanism that raises and lowers the door may stick resulting in flooding. When I say flooding I don't mean it floods your kitchen, the washer immediately goes into an alarm error mode that empties the water and will not stop buzzing until you cut the power to the washer.\n\nThe first time my FP flooded I called in a serviceman. I watched him fix it, and subsequently each time I had a flooding error I, myself, took out the drawer, mopped up the water with a bath towel, dried out the space, put back on the drawer . But this is not an easy thing and is annoying particularly if this one hour job happens a couple times a year.  The serviceman told me in his opinion the washer is well built and if the user is very careful to load it and operate it as instructed by the manual, it is a good product.\n\nBut parts are expensive and it needed about $400 worth at age 12, so I now have a new Bosch. I miss the ease of loading and dry dishes the FP gave me. But I suspect, despite the daily stooping, and inconvenience in loading the Bosch , I hope it will serve me will less major trouble than did the FP.", "summary": "Pros and Cons", "originalRating": 3.0, "ourRating": "", "modelRating": ""}

{"reviewText": "Like other reviewers said the instruction manual is a bit lacking but it's not hard to figure out. When you're washing your clothes, make sure the dial is set to \"wash\" and when  you're spin drying, set it to \"spin\".\n\nThis product is best for thinner fabrics like dri-fit gym clothes. I can't imagine using it for sweaters or woolens, especially since the spin drying bucket is small.\n\nTips:\n* You will need to do 3 cycles on this machine per load. Prewash, wash, rinse. I tried washing one load with just wash & rinse and the clothes weren't fully clean.\n* There's 2 lines/markings on the side with \"H\" and \"L\" next to them. Make sure the water line doesn't go pass the \"H\" line. If you over fill, the agitation will fling water out of the machine\n* With the bucket empty, make sure your load (dry clothing) does not fill the bucket more than halfway.\n* Separate each load into 2 spin cycles\n\nPros:\n* Tiny and lightweight, so you can store it anywhere. Great for RVs and small apartments.\n* Agitator is stronger than expected for a machine of this size\n\nCons:\n* Every time I use the machine, there's a slight electrical burn smell. Makes me feel like this machine isn't going to last long\n* The spin mode is \"good\" but could be stronger to spin more water out. Before I put each piece of clothing into the spin bucket, I need to wring it out a bit. It leaves clothes just dry enough to not drip water but still pretty damp. If it's cold and humid, clothes going to take 24 hours to hang dry.\n* You need to apply some weight on top of the machine during the spin cycle or it shakes too much\n\nOverall:\nFor the price, it's a great machine. Especially when you're in a pinch and just need to wash a few intimates, I don't need to go all the way to the laundromat. For apartment dwellers, the spin cycle is a bit noisy. You might want to skip it and just wring out your clothes of excess water.", "summary": "Like other reviewers said the instruction manual is a bit ...", "originalRating": 3.0, "ourRating": "", "modelRating": ""}

If you heed the warnings and make the necessary adjustments relative to installation you should have a roof cap that provides trouble-free performance for years.\n\nPROS:\n\n1. A reasonably well-manufactured residential low-profile roof cap made from 24 gauge CRCQ  galvanized steel (frame).and aluminum internal sub-parts.\n2. Black electrically-bonded epoxy finish\n3. Integral back-draft damper and bird screen\n4. Clear and relatively straightforward installation instructions.\n\nCONS:\n\n1.

If you have an electron microscope, you will see that the item is actually a hybrid product globally sourced. The manufacturer does not provide details as to which parts are manufactured in the US.\n2. This item should be supplied with the proprietary 4\" DC4 duct collar necessary for proper installation, but you need to purchase this separately ($6.61) or purchase the RVK1A Roof Ducting \"Kit\"  which supplies all you should need for the job-two tie wraps,8' of 4\" diameter flexible foil duct transition hose, the duct collar and a strip of self-sticking compression-type weather-seal.\n3. The \"bird screen\" is simply a loose-fitting light gauge wire screen which can and will be penetrated by some birds and most definitely by ambitious squirrels searching for safe harbor, moisture and nesting.

If you purchase the Broan kit (cited above) DO NOT USE the 8' compression duct hose. In most municipalities and townships, this is clearly not compliant with fire codes and regulations and will also trap more lint in the inner lining of the hose restricting air flow and creating a potential hazard. Instead, purchase a semi-rigid 4-8' section of smooth fire-rated aluminum duct available at most big box hardware stores and certainly any roofing supply outlet.\n3. Skip the cheap tie-wraps furnished in the Broan kit if you purchased this-They are flimsy and do not yield a tight and secure grip on each duct junction. Buy two 4-5\" stainless steel adjustable clamps.\n3. Prior to installation, be certain to insure that the duct collar is properly installed into the roof cap aperture (opening). To do this, you will need to seat the seal with a good caliber roofing cement and seal all nails with this compound as well to assure water-resistance.", "summary": "About As Good As It Gets For Now But Still Something To \"Vent\" About", "originalRating": 3.0, "ourRating": "", "modelRating": ""}

So far, it's worked just fine. This is not OEM, but looks and works like just it (except the one I got was green in color). The unit I received has the motor, impeller, and \"drain trap\" assembly, so it's a complete unit. Installation took about ten minutes. Being aftermarket I don't know how long it will hold up, but so far so good and hopefully it will last at least a few years. I assume it is made in China, but nothing was indicated so I can't say for sure. This seller shipped fast, and it arrived quite a bit earlier than expected plus the price was the best around. Overall very satisfied.\n\nUPDATE 1/12/14\n\nIt's been just under five months and this part has totally failed. The impeller looks like it's sheared from is shaft, or whatever it would be called. The plastic looks like it's been torn up and is detached from the rest of the part. There is also a black rubber semi circular piece that's in there, which I can't figure out the reason for as the OEM didn't have it.

{"reviewText": "I'm sure the other reviewers received a working product. I did too, for the first few days. However, I had to have a service guy come out within the first week the fridge was delivered because the CustomChill door temperature selector buttons stopped working and the freezer drawer light doesn't work. The issue appears to be with the electronics or wiring. The technician has been out 3 times, and the problem still isn't fixed. To note, it's been a month and a half since the first visit. He has to contact LG directly while here because they haven't released the specs to technicians. After 2 part swaps, the issue remains. He said I should be getting a call from LG soon. I hope it's to replace the fridge.\nWe bought the fridge to replace a 14 year old 26cu ft KitchenAid side-by-side because we wanted something more energy efficient. I was hesitant because the new models (from any manufacturer) have a lot of plastic pieces and metal-on-plastic pieces. This means those parts will wear out quicker and you (the consumer) will have to pay to fix them or buy a new fridge. Since it was on all similar models, we decided to go with LG because of overall reviews. The compressor probably will last since it's mechanical and LG puts a long warranty on it. We were a little disappointed with all the plastic because of the high price.\nThe door-in-door is nice, but you have to really push on it to get it to stay closed instead of just swinging it closed. As annoying as it is, keep the door alarm activated. This has saved us from leaving the door-in-door open because it didn't close. Plan on two hand use for the ice and water dispensers. The water dispenser symbol will inevitably get scratched off soon because it's only painted on instead of etched in. The paint on ours already has some chips on it - again, cost savings for LG. The ice machine is small, and cubes have a tendency to build up in front of the sensor. This causes the machine to stop making ice because it senses the bucket is full, but it is not. This happens 2-3 times a week and always on the side closest to the door hinges. I recommend checking it often and knocking the ice down. The ice machine makes the left door stick out farther, so be sure to have plenty of room to open it fully. Otherwise, you can't reach in to grab items in the back of the fridge. Inside the fridge, there's plenty of room, and the space is configurable. The shelves are sturdy and can handle heavy items without flexing. The fridge compartment is also deep. My wife is 5'3\" and can't reach to the back of the top shelves.\nI can't comment on the CustomChill drawer because we can't change the temperature, and we have no idea what the temperature is because the lights don't work. The sliding dividers are a nice option though to keep meats and other products separated.\nThe freezer has 2 other drawers in there. However, this results in only a 10-inch clearance in the main compartment. I can't stand bottles up because of this. We spend a lot more time digging around for things too because the main compartment is deep and extend underneath the other drawers. Also, there is nothing filtering out the moisture in the air. Everything has ice crystals on the outside.\nThe enormous size of the fridge presented problems when the delivery guys were trying to get it into my house. They had to pull out the drawers and take off the front door handles. Then, they had to open the doors and pivot the fridge through 34\" wide doorway openings. Something to remember if you ever plan on getting it OUT of your house.\nOverall, we still have mix feelings about the fridge since we haven't noticed any decrease in this month's electric bill. The broken CustomChill drawer also colors our opinion of the fridge. Couple that with the liberal use of plastic-on-plastic and plastic-on-metal parts, and it's only a matter of time before new parts are needed (or a new fridge). The cost of the fridge is too much for this fact. However, I do want to reiterate again, that all the other fridges from other manufacturers did the exact same thing. Hopefully, this review provides some insight for those searching for a new fridge. If you want this one, then buy it on sale.", "summary": "Read before buying", "originalRating": 2.0, "ourRating": "", "modelRating": ""}

If I hadn't been standing there to notice what had happened, I'd have been none-the-wiser with the gas coming out. 2. If you turn the cooktop knob too fast, it bypasses the lighting of the flame, and then again, just gas is coming out. (My husband did this. He had too quickly turned on the cooktop to pre-heat the pan, but he never noticed that there was not an actual flame lit under the pan.) These both seem like safety issues to me.

It shouldnt be this hard and shame on the company for making the customer own the risk.  One star review because I identified the issue immediately, they didn't budge, and three years later we have had numerous problems with leaks.\n\nOverall the keg is great, keeps the beer super cold.  Taps aren't great, no tower cooler, no individual keg shut off valve, no extra clamps, co2 valve doesnt show how much is in the keg.  Rest of the kit is good and lets you switch between homebrew and commercial easily.\n\n  If I had to do it all over again I would just buy the keg and piece my own kit together.

{"reviewText": "Even though the reviews were consistently mediocre, I still bought this cooler because it was the only one in this price range that could fit the dimensions and location for my use.  I've validated what others have stated:  The Temperature is inaccurate and fluctuates wildly in certain ranges within this cooler.  With the picture below, it's just over 60 degrees in the front middle of the fridge noted with the Taylor thermometer, but in other areas of the cooler, I've validated with a laser thermometer, that it gets to 55 deg in the bottom and the back, and at the top it gets to 68 degrees).  I've snapped a photo attached as well.\n\nAlso as others have stated, wide/large bottles will not fit in this fridge, so I have a few larger pinot bottles that have to sit up top, while moving a rack down to accommodate them (fortunately I have small half bottles that can use the smaller rack space).\n\nWhat I've come to understand is this cooler needs a lot of space around it for air flow and you can not store anything on top of it, so if you can accommodate this cooler in a location with proper ventilation, you'll get a little better temp readings (I validated this by running it in the middle of the room for a few days and the temp dropped closer to setting, but only by 4-5 degrees).\n\nFor $220 I don't know if there's a better option/other units with similar bottle counts are more expensive or have worse reviews.  I will say my Vinotemp cooler has held up exceptionally and I now use it only for champagne and whites while I use the Akdy for reds.

However the plastic drawer, which was also blue taped in place, was placed into the unit after it was completely damaged with large cracks along its entire back (see photo). As per some other reviewers who also posted the same problem, it appears whoever put the drawer in attempted to fix the large cracks with some clear tape.

{"reviewText": "A neighbor discarded one of these - brand-new, never been plugged in. It is cute, but the design seemed a bit off. It is not a very good design. Each of the four indents that hold a \"pizza\" is quite small - about three fairly small bites.\n\nI download the owner's manual online and followed the instruction as best I could. The dough recipe has no leavening and lots of butter. The instructions were a bit vague, but it seems you sort of spread the rolled out dough discs into the indents while the machine is cold(ish). Once the filling is added, you plug it in. There are two lights that aren't particularly useful - power and \"ready\" (which lights up long before the \"pizza\" is actually cooked or \"ready\").\n\nThe resulting \"pizza\" is really more of a topless tart. Even rolling out thin, the crust is doughy inside with the outside a bit crispy. The filling is still quite wet, since it is almost as deep as it is wide and can't get hot enough throughout to cook completely.\n\nMaking these \"pizzas\" is a bit tedious, spraying with oil,  spreading in the dough, spooning in a small bit of filling, plugging in the machine, waiting a few minutes, trying to decide if the dough is crispy on the outside, unplugging the machine, getting each out of its hot indent without scratching the non-stick coating or burning yourself, letting it cool a bit, and then repeating for the next scant serving (actually, I could easily eat eight of these at those times when I would normally chow down on pizza...!).\n\nCleaning is a bit difficult, as it does not disassemble, so you have to wash the cooking surfaces without getting water inside. The only solution I could find is to prop it up sideways on the edge of the sink and use a brush and sprayer. Too awkward.\n\nIt's a cute idea. It is reasonably well built, but flawed design. It was fun doing these with my 4-year-old son (we cook together a lot, he's getting to be a good cook). But it was too much work for mediocre results. They were edible mainly because I seasoned to my taste, but the maker needs to return to the drawing table and design something actually practical.\n\nI'm glad I didn't pay anything for this, and will probably pass it on to a thrift store.", "summary": "Cute, but flawed design", "originalRating": 2.0, "ourRating": "", "modelRating": ""}

Took us a while to figure out how to use the probe. The elements on the cooktop are excellent. Our other one had a kind-of turbo boil, but had a time limitation to prevent electronics from overheating. This one has a quick boil that will stay in super mode until the pot boils over (yes, my wife still has not figured out NOT to walk away from the stove when boiling stuff!). It is fast! The warming tray below is nice, but we principally use it for storage. The display is easy to read and after reading the manual (please sit down with coffee, etc. and take the time!) things are generally intuitive.\n\nWhy the missing star?? Smelly. It's been used for a while now and you can still get a whiff of \"out gassing\" of hot internals. It is really pronounce when it was first used a few times. We had to air out the kitchen, in fact. We kind'a knew this would happen because we bought a similar product for my daughter. We were REALLY concerned something was frying inside (besides the food, that is!). So brace yourself - it will eventually go away.\nAnother thing is a mixed blessing. It is quieter (fan noise) than others, but the caveat is that the panel gets very warm; close to hot.

{"reviewText": "Our Whirlpool washer recently developed a problem with spin cycles, so the clothes came out looking very wet.  The service mode displayed errors F7 E5 (shifter actuator fault) and F7 E1 (basket speed sensor fault).  Sometimes the actuator could be heard hunting back and forth at the start of a wash cycle.  I removed the actuator assembly for inspection and found two broken PC board traces which affected the shift sensor circuit.  They were corroded due to the presence of an unknown contaminant.  I bridged the broken traces using insulated 30 gauge wire (soldered to component leads at the endpoints of the traces) and reinstalled the actuator assembly into the washer.  Everything worked fine after the repairs, so the source of the problem was identified and fixed.  A new W10006355 actuator assembly was later installed since the repair was considered temporary.  The replacement actuator works well, and the new PC board has a protective coating which should offer some protection against corrosion.  The washer operates like new again, so we are happy with the results.\n\nUPDATE:  Five months after the repair, the replacement actuator has also failed with the same symptoms.  Upon disassembly, I discovered that one of the two previously corroded PCB traces was corroded as well, breaking the shift sensor circuit.  What is going on here?  I'm guessing that the speed sensor opening below the basket is leaking a small amount of fluid onto the actuator PCB and causing the corrosion.  The corroded traces on the lower edge of the board are very narrow, so it doesn't take very long for them to disintegrate when exposed to contaminants.  The splash shield that is supposed to protect the board from fluids is apparently not sufficient.  I bridged the narrow traces with 30 gauge insulated wire as before, and drilled small drainage holes in the plastic housing at the board insertion point where the corrosion occurs, so hopefully that will delay the next failure.  I duplicated the modifications on the original actuator assembly, so now I have a spare.  If both of those fail, it's time for a new washer.", "summary": "Fixed shifter fault; high failure rate when exposed to contaminants", "originalRating": 3.0, "ourRating": "", "modelRating": ""}

{"reviewText": "I decided it was time to replace my old, but faithful Top Freezer (by Whirlpool). It was showing wear and the compressor was starting to sound stressed and worn. Being the mechanical geek I am, I figured it was a good excuse.\n\nSo, i went out shopping prior to black friday and my options where very slim. There are only 6 or so models that will fit into a 32\" opening and this was one... Given it had excellent reviews all around and the price was quite cheap on Black Friday, I scooped one up..\n\nWhen I first got the fridge, I was thrilled. Water in the door (NO ice though), pur filtration system, a neat half shelf. A nice big deli/meat/whatever drawer.. I was stoked...\n\nHowever, with in a week, I quickly knew this love was gone, and with in 6 weeks, I would have a completely different fridge\n\nThere are many things to like:\nIt fits into a small space nicely, it looks really sleek, its got a really powerful ice maker, a dispenser for chilled water, a nice water filter (that's easy to change), the controls are simple to use. It seems like a perfect package\n\nBut what I didn't like:\nCheap, CHEAP, CHEAP quality. The door bins are made out what I am guessing to be a polycarbonite blend of some form. They don't feel like they will hold up over long term use. In fact, i've read and seen where they have broken. I had an issue with the trim around the glass for the deli drawer (see picture). In fact the deli drawer and crisper drawers are made of the same material, and because of there larger surface area, they will bend and flex in your hand. Plus the drawers do not roll smoothly at all.. They are very rough and feel like there rolling on gravel\n\nThere are 2 full width shelves, with the middle one having a shelf that slides in. That's nice.. However, the top shelf will bow if you put to much on it. It very much flexes and again, has a cheap feel to it. The second shelf with the slider shelf is far sturdier but, with the shelf slid back, there is very little useable area. its a long L shaped thing with about 10\" front to back of useable space with the part slid in and then to the side there is about 16\" side to side and the full depth. Its enough, but oddly configured.\n\nForget putting large bottles in here with out sliding that half shelf back. They won't fit and there's no way to configure the shelves to make that happen. Since there's only full shelves and a few slides for them, its impossible to reorder the shelves in any other way. Its very annoying and even for two people, it quickly usurps all the space inside\n\nThe crisper drawers where another huge complaint.. One they where that cheap, flimsy plastic.. Two, they where of differing sizes, one being rather large, one being rectangular. It didn't quite make any sense to me what so ever. Plus there is this fresh keeper gizmo in the drawer to keep produce decent. It didn't seem to work for my stuff, but maybe that's because mine would not keep the temps steady. Also, the bigger of the two drawers didn't seal shut at all, there was 1/8\"-1/2\" gap in between the shelf and the top lip of the drawer. I've noticed this same gap in several display models. Overall it just felt cheap\n\nThe deli drawer is really nice and of a good size, but again, cheap plastic materials and the trim around the front edge that feels so thin and cheap, almost like plastic mini blinds that have been in the sun for  10 years. It wouldn't even stay attached.\n\nBack to the door bins. You can forget using most of the bins for gallon jugs. Only the bottom right one will hold a gallon of milk. There is a tilt out/pull out condiment tray and its a nice idea, but the extra space used to make it tilt and come out, could have been put to use with another gallon sized door bin, thus allevating the need to always have that half shelf slid back (we always have several things of juice going so that alone would have been a huge help). The door bins won't hold really tall items either in the middle and there's no way to re order them to do so. You either need to put them in the tilt out condiment gizmo or hope there not too tall for the top bin. Steak sauce and so forth has to go in either place. And mostly on the left door. The right door can't handle too many tall bottles.\n\nOne perk is the really nice interior lighting. If you need a bright, cheerful interior for you're fridge, this is it. My replacement I noticed is very much lacking in this area. I can live with a dimly lit fridge though (You can see every corner very clearly in this whirlpool.\n\nThe pull out freezer is very nice, the bins are full plastic and are made from a much more durable plastic imho. The ice maker is wonderful and when mine actually worked, it produced alot of ice in a short time. However, the bottom part of the freezer drawer (the bottom bin) has a 65 degree angle built into it. YOU CAN NOT fit pizza boxes down here. I had bags of frozen veggies and so forth stacked down here and it worked fine for that. i had a few boxes of other things mixed in as well and that was ok. but we tried putting just vacuum wrapped pizza down there and it got all bent. They won't fit in the top drawer either. The ice bin usurps most of the space and it just isn't big enough for a boxed pizza. A vacuum sealed one maybe. But that's an if. And then you have to stick your ice cream and such up there as the drawer won't close with ice cream in the bottom bin unless you stick it all the way on the bottom and then it may get burried under the other frozen foods. The freezer was decent overall, just hard to figure out how to best use the space\n\nMy main issue was the lack of temperature control. I dunno if my unit was just bad or what, but I could never keep an even temp in the unit. The front display and the manual recommend 3 snowflakes for both compartments. 3 snow flakes for the fridge would sometimes sour milk and spoil stuff, other times it would freeze everything. 4 snowflakes almost always froze everything and seemed to make everything rot/spoil just as fast. I've never had celery go bad in 4 days before. Ive also never had a fridge that would freeze everything in the back and spoil everything up front. It was just awful trying to keep it at an even temp. I in fact lost some very expensive medication because it froze and  was ruined. That sent me over the edge. The snow flakes are \"cute\" and a \"novel\" idea, but lets go back to a bar or number system. 1-5 works for me.. The energy saver setting is hard to set on the controls and I dunno, it just seems there are too many buttons and such for the simple functions. Its easy to figure out, just seems overly complex. My unit also had an issue with the door alarm not working and about a week before its return, it started working. The light for the water dispenser looks nice, but its just a joke really. Overall, I was not impressed with the user interface for this fridge. It can't hold a temp and the controls just seem over the top.\n\nMy only other issues where the doors (or how they closed) and the finish on the sides\n\nThe left door was hard to keep closed. I've noted this on almost every in store model I've looked at and its been mentioned in a number of reviews. If you open just the left door, you need to slam it hard to get it to close all the way. and then the right one pops open. Or if you open just the right door, the left one pops open. Some times you have to slam the left one to even get it to close. It was annoying because several times the left door got left open/ajar and the darn door alarm didn't beep, so that didn't help the temp. control. A big part of what is the door latch mechanism and there is this long \"pillar\" in between both doors, that's hinged on to the left door. I'm not sure what purpose that pillar serves, but that pillar makes it difficult for the doors to close properly with out slamming them. Plus the latch system requires the pins to slide in a track of sorts and that track is just molded into the fridge liner.. Overall, its a very poor and odd design for a french door fridge. Its not one i've seen used much and it doesn't need to be used. There are many refrigerators with french doors that don't need a pillar.\n\nThe last part is minor. The outside parts of the cabinet look like cheap plastic.. Although a very nice finish, they just look and feel like heavily grained plastic. On the stainless steel models (as an fyi) this is gray plastic, which looks very nice. It just feels cheap\n\nTo sum everything up, this is a very nice fridge for a small kitchen and a small family. More than 3 people and I think your gonna need a second fridge (we got a second fridge because it couldn't hold all of our juice and drinks). If you can use the space and are good playing fridge tetris, you might like this. If you are gentle and easy on stuff, the flimsy feel to the plastic may not bug you.\n\nBut, the lack of temp control, the fact that my unit lasted 6 weeks before need catostrophic repairs and the fact it just feels very cheap and flimsy and doesn't feel of good quality, should turn you away. I am a former appliance repair tech and a major mechanical geek and I will tell you, this is the most sorry product I've ever bought. I am glad that the store stood behind the product as well, as the manufacturer did not. In fact, some of the issues I've noted here are known complaints with this model and there are repairs for them, but the manufacturer doesn't see fit to offer those with out much prodding.\n\nIf you can live with the above, this will be an awesome fridge. But I hope this gives you my .02 cents on what I feel was a huge mistake. I'm just glad I was able to exchange my unit at no cost for a different brand that better fits my needs", "summary": "There are better choices", "originalRating": 1.0, "ourRating": "", "modelRating": ""}
